# About Me
My name is Jackson. I've always loved school and thought education was deeply important, and after three years at BYU I decided to pursue a career in higher education. Specifically, I'm interested in religious education; I plan to study education in graduate school and become a professor of religion here at BYU. This blog is a record of a few of the things I've worked on during my undergraduate statistics degree.

On the side, I like to write music and read books.
