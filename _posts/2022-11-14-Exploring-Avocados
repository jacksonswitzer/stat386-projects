## Introduction (and a due apology)

First, I need to apologize. Fans of the blog will know I promised an analysis of the Rate My Professors data of BYU religion faculty. The issue is, Rate My Professors updated their code since I wrote my webscraping blog, and my code no longer works. I should have saved the dataframe, I know. But I didn't. After an hour fiddling around, I decided it wasn't worth the time to keep trying to get it working again. So this exploratory data analysis, unfortunately, is about something else.

I promise this analysis is ethical, just as the collection of my previous dataset was. I downloaded the data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/neuromusic/avocado-prices). It's a public Kaggle dataset. My title picture is also available for public use, taken from Wikimedia Commons.

The purpose of today's post is to get an overall feel for the sales of avocados in the United States over the past few years.

## Distribution of Average Weekly Prices


## Average Sales by Region


## Average Price Over Time
