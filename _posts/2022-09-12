I'm just learning how to enter text and how it looks in the blog when I'm finished.

I put two spaces before this line for a new line, because I think that's how markdown works.  
The end of the previous line had two spaces and a single newline.
The end of the previous line had no spaces and a single newline.

Don't worry, Dr. Tass, I'll delete this post once I start using this blog as an actual display of my work.
